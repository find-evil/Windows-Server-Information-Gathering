I wrote these one day at work to help conduct (manual) security audits.\r\n\r\nPopulate c:\\Servers.txt with one hostname or IP address per line. Must be resolvable hostnames, or timeouts will occur and the script will drag, best to do this in preprocessing\r\n\r\nYou must open PowerShell with a network account that will have Administrator rights on the machines you intend to query. I prefer to run cmd.exe and then open PowerShell from that command line (and keep it open).\r\n\r\nYou may also need to login to the individual machines and install WMI (type \"wmic\" at the command line).\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy recon!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
